    <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
    <p>
      Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Daniel Bishop, a software engineer
      with a passion for fitness, sports, and travel. Currently, I'm pursuing a
      Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Computer Science and a minor in
      Economics at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you can find me in the gym, playing squash, or
      planning my next adventure. Speaking of which, I'm currently traveling
      around Europe as part of a university exchange program with the University
      of Nottingham in the UK. It's been an incredible experience so far, and
      I've had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world while
      studying and exploring new places.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website serves as a platform for me to showcase my work and share my
      projects, CV, and anything else that I find relevant. I'm continually
      updating and improving it, so make sure to check back regularly for
      updates.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my website!</p>
