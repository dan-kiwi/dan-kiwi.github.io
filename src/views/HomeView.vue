    <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Daniel Bishop and I am currently studying at the University
      of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. I am studying towards a
      Bachelor of Science, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in
      Economics.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website is to showcase my work and to provide a place for me to show
      my projects, CV and anything else I think is relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website is still a work in progress. I hope to add to it as I
      progress through my degree and career.
