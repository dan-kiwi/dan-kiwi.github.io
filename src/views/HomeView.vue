    <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
    <p>
      Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Daniel Bishop, currently a student at the University of Canterbury in
      Christchurch, New Zealand. I'm studying towards a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Computer Science and a
      minor in Economics.

      I'm passionate about technology and enjoy learning about new and emerging technologies. I'm particularly interested
      in web development, and I'm currently working on several projects to improve my skills in this area. I'm also
      interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I'm looking forward to learning more about these
      fields in the future.
    </p>

      When I'm not coding, you can find me in the gym, playing squash, or planning my next adventure. Speaking of which, I
      have recently returned from Europe as part of a university exchange program with the University of Nottingham. It
      was an incredible experience, with the opportunity to meet people from all over the world while studying and
      exploring new places.

      This website serves as a platform for me to showcase my work and share my projects, CV, and anything else that I
      find relevant. I'm continually updating and improving it, so make sure to check back regularly for updates.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my website!</p>
