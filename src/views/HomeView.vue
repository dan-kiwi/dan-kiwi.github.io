    <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
    <p>
      Hello 👋! I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Canterbury,
      balancing academic rigour with real-world experience as a full-stack
      developer at a burgeoning software startup in Christchurch. Passionate
      about technological innovation, I'm also in the early stages of launching
      my own tech startup aimed at revolutionizing the farming marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>👨‍💻 What I Do:</p>
    <p>
      As a full-stack developer, I've had the opportunity to work on various
      projects that have honed my skills in languages like Typescript, Python
      and Java. I specialize in building intuitive, scalable applications that
      drive business value. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and
      have a knack for solving complex problems.
    </p>
    <p>🌱 Entrepreneurial Spirit:</p>
    <p>
      My interest doesn't stop at coding. I am currently working on a startup
      that aims to optimize this market by reducing middleman involvement and
      offering real-time pricing information. I'm involved in everything from
      business strategy to product development, and I'm keen to make an impact
      on sustainable farming practices through technology.
    </p>
    <p>📚 Academic Background:</p>
    <p>
      I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of
      Canterbury. My academic journey has provided me with a strong theoretical
      foundation in computer science, which complements my practical experience.
      I am particularly interested in algorithms, data structures, and
      artificial intelligence.This website serves as a platform for me to
      showcase my work and share my projects, CV, and anything else that I find
      relevant. I'm continually updating and improving it, so make sure to check
      back regularly for updates.
    </p>
    <p>💪 Work-Life Balance:</p>
    <p>
      When I'm not buried in code or business plans, you'll find me at the gym
      or playing squash. I believe that a healthy body fuels a healthy mind,
      which in turn, makes me more productive and focused.
    </p>
    <p>🎯 Goals:</p>
    <p>
      My career focus is startup-centric. Whether it's successfully launching my
      own startup or contributing to another innovative startup, I am committed
      to being part of dynamic teams that aim to disrupt industries and redefine
      paradigms.
